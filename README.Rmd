# Rthoptera <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="150" alt="" /></a>

*Rthoptera* provides interactive Shiny applications for standard analysis of insect sounds. The package is intended to be used on high signal-to-noise recordings, helping researchers make standardized measurements and plots to support the scientific description of the "acoustic types", which are the first description of the calling song of a species, which should be accompanied by a high-quality recording and ideally the voucher specimen identifier in the collection it was deposited. For the convenience of users, we have included functions for pre-processing audio files, which are already available in other packages (e.g., *tuneR*, *seewave*), but here they are interactive (Shiny apps). Most of the plotting functions are based on the *seewave* package, with the convenience of presets and automatic parameter selection (e.g., window length for the spectrograms) to ensure clarity in any Wave regardless of the recording settings. Most of these plots also have interactive versions which can be saved as HTML documents.

## Preprocessing

Please visit the
[Preprocess](https://naturewaves.github.io/Rthoptera/articles/Preprocess.html "Preprocessing Audio Files with Rthoptera")
page for guidance on how and when to use these tools.

-   **Import**: Browse your local data to import audio files (WAV) as
    Wave objects into R. During this process, the waveform is centered
    to zero with the `rmoffset()` function to ensure accurate
    measurements.

-   **Downsample**: When required and appropriate, you can reduce the
    sampling rate of your audio files. This helps improve the computing
    speed for certain analyses and plots without losing important sound
    features.

-   **Band-pass Filter**: When necessary, apply a user-defined high-pass
    and/or low-pass filter to eliminate noise or non-target sounds from
    your audio recordings.

-   **Trim**: Using an interactive oscillogram, you can visually select
    and trim specific sections of a Wave object. The trimmed sections
    can be saved as new Wave objects in your R environment for further
    analysis.

-   **Merge**: Useful when one needs to concatenate several wave files
    together for certain analyses.

## Analysis

Once preprocessing is complete, users can launch analysis tools to
extract spectral and temporal statistics from your audio files:

-   **Spectral Statistics**: Automatically calculate spectral metrics
    based on the mean power spectrum of a Wave object.

-   **Temporal Statistics**: Automatically extract temporal metrics from
    your audio recordings. This includes identifying and analyzing
    elements ("tooth impacts"), trains (syllables), and echemes (groups
    of syllables or trills) in the insect sounds. Two apps are
    available:

-   `call_stats_hq` is optimized to work with "tonal" (i.e., "high-Q")
    signals, such as those produced by most crickets. It creates an
    envelope of the waveform and measures the duration of **trains**
    (i.e., "pulses") and gaps based on a user-defined detection
    threshold, then aggregating them into **motifs** (i.e., "echemes")
    and, optionally, into **motif sequences**.

-   `call_stats_lq` works better for broadband calls usually produced by
    katydids, bush-crickets, water-bugs, etc, including those with wide
    amplitude variability, where the threshold approach would leave
    fainter sounds undetected or poorly measured. The main difference
    with the "hq" app is the granularity: this app detects each **peak**
    in the envelope, often corresponding to a single tooth impact, and
    groups them into **trains** (e.g., "pulses", "syllables"),
    **motifs** (e.g., "echemes"), and **motif sequences** using
    user-defined thresholds.

## Visualisation

-   **Multi-Power Spectrum**: An interactive tool that overlays multiple
    power spectrum plots selected from the oscillogram, allowing for
    easy comparison and visualization of spectral features across
    different time intervals. Each selection is assigned to its own
    color (colorblind-safe) both in the oscillogram and the mean
    spectrum plots.

-   **Spectrogram**: Generate standard spectrograms, optionally
    alongside a lateral mean power spectrum. This combination allows you
    to visualize both time-frequency representations and the overall
    spectral distribution. The spectrogram window size is automatically
    adjusted based on the sampling rate and duration of the recording to
    obtain a standard frequency/time resolution trade-off.

-   **Multi Plot**: A combined visualization of the spectrogram, mean
    spectrum, and oscillogram, providing a comprehensive view of both
    the time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics of the insect
    sounds.

-   **Oscillogram**: Create standard oscillograms as well as interactive
    oscillograms that allow you to zoom in and explore specific sections
    of the waveform.

-   **Multi-oscillogram**: Create a stacked oscillogram plot for
    0comparing the sounds of multiple species. This is particularly
    useful for analyzing the differences in acoustic patterns between
    species.

-   **Zoomed oscillogram**: Create a static oscillogram with stacked
    zoomed portions selected interactively.
