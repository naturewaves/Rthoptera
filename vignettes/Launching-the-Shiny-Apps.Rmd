## How to launch an app
In *Rthoptera*, most of the relevant functions come with a Shiny app companion. To explore which apps are available, run:
```{r}
library(Rthoptera)
launch_app()
```
The `launch_app()` function supports partial matching, which means that, for example, if you want to run the "import_wave" app, you can just type:
```{r}
launch_app("import")
```
and `Rthoptera` will launch the "import_wave" app. However, some apps have longer and similar names, for which you will need to type more characters. For example, if you run:
```{r}
launch_app("temporal_stats")
```
`Rthoptera` will ask you to specify further.
