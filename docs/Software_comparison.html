<p>Before the development of <em>Rthoptera</em>, being dissatisfied with
the image output provided by the available bioacoustics software
packages to create meaningful and clear illustrations suitable for
scientific publication, the authors used screenshots from the relevant
views obtained by closed-source software, mostly Adobe Audition (Adobe
Inc., 2023).</p>
<p>Obviously, not being conceived for such usage, the screenshots need
extensive manual refinements, that require the coordinated use of other
closed-source software, that usually include MS-Paint and Adobe
Photoshop. After the selection of the relevant portion of the audio
file, the bare minimum of activities needed includes:</p>
<p>• Taking a screenshot (i.e., copying current screen content in the
RAM image clipboard);</p>
<p>• Pasting the screenshot in the image editing environment;</p>
<p>• Improving image clarity by adjusting image levels (e.g.,
brightness, contrast, sharpness, etc.). Other post-production
interventions needed may include image mode conversion (color to black
&amp; white or vice-versa) and feature (e.g., grid lines) removal;</p>
<p>• Adding readable vertical and horizontal axes, including tick marks,
values and labels: even though the original screenshot may include such
information, the on-screen font size is usually too small to be
readable. Furthermore, if a non-initial section of the audio file is
illustrated, the on-screen horizontal time scale does not start with
zero, which complicates its reading. For those reasons, suitably sized
and zeroed horizontal and vertical scales need to be juxtaposed to the
image, in a time-consuming process. Usually, under Windows operating
system, this activity is performed with MS-Paint. On average, obtaining
each image may require from 10 to 20 minutes of work (e.g., as in Brizio
et al., 2021). The raster images emerging from the process described are
sufficiently clear, but there are drawbacks, including:</p>
<p>• Image content is limited to the views available in the audio
analysis software: usually, this boils down to time/pressure envelopes,
spectrograms and mean spectra;</p>
<p>• Composite images (e.g. time/pressure envelopes at different time
scales, or combination of mean spectra and spectrogram) cannot be
obtained in a single passage, and require a mosaic of separately
generated images;</p>
<p>• Images do not include any data besides those appearing in the image
itself. If further data are needed for the purpose of the publication,
they must be obtained in other ways, typically by manual transcription
of values read on screen, often obtained by suitably positioning the
mouse pointer, e.g. in the case of the reading of pressure levels from
mean spectra (not forgetting that the pixel-wise process of pointer
positioning is inconsistent and error-prone);</p>
<p>• Image style (e.g., color coding of pressure levels) may vary from
one image to another, depending on the software used for screenshot
generation.</p>
<p>The whole process described above is highly dependent from the skill,
the experience and the individual sensitivity of each operator, and
consistency of the results by different operators is not fully
granted.</p>
<p>This is an example of a Mean Power Spectrum extracted from a
screenshot from Adobe Audition and post-processed in Microsoft Paint and
Adobe Photoshop to change the color scale and add new axes labels,
requiring about 10 minutes to produce:
<img src="../images/ctenodecticus_bolivari_audition_microsoft.png" width="1500"></p>
<p>Below is the same plot type produced by <em>Rthoptera</em> (using
normalized amplitude instead of dB FS). Including the selection of the
file, changing scale parameters and custom labels on the Y-axis,
modifying the output dimensions, and typing down the species name and
call type, it took 45 seconds to produce:
<img src="../images/ctenodecticus_spectral_plot.png" width="1500"></p>
<p><em>Rthoptera</em> is capable to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of the image generation phase:</p>
<p>• by granting a more objective approach: the user chooses the
parameters’ values, and the image plus data tables generation is
entirely and consistently managed by <em>Rthoptera</em>, excluding the
vagaries of a lengthy manual process and the impact of different
operator’s habits or manual skills;</p>
<p>• by granting an advantage in terms of time required for image
generation: even though R and RStudio are not especially suited for
bioacoustic analyses, the worst-case scenario observed during the tests
(up to 100 seconds for the generation of a composite image with
<em>Rthoptera</em>) compares very favorably with the 20 or 30 minutes
required to obtain a comparable image by the screenshot-based process
illustrated above;</p>
<p>• by generating the publication-ready plots, including composite
illustrations (i.e., “multiplot”) that would be even more time consuming
to generate otherwise with a multi-software approach.</p>
<p>• by simultaneously producing multiple tabular datasets that would
have required separate software (e.g., Excel) to manipulate;</p>
<p>• by providing new metrics (Pattern Complexity, Broadband Activity…)
that may set a standard for future investigations.</p>

</h3>
<p>NOTE: For this comparison we used a machine with Windows 11 Home, 64
bit, 16 GB RAM.</p>
<p><strong>Raven Pro 1.6</strong> (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, 2021) is
a dedicated bioacoustics software build by and for scientists. Even the
free version <strong>Raven Lite</strong> offers a suite of useful tools
for acoustic analysis, and is extensively used by researchers in
acoustic communication of birds, anurans, bats, and other mammals. One
disadvantage of this software is its proprietary nature, limiting the
user’s ability to customize the plots and forcing them to rely on extra
software to obtain the desired results. The plot shown below took about
70 seconds to make in <strong>Raven Pro 1.6</strong>, including
un-checking the position marker (which is wrongly shown in many
scientific publications), adjusting the zoom level on the oscillogram,
the window size and contrast for the spectrogram, and finally changing
to grey scale in Microsoft Office, which does not allow to control the
output dimensions either:
<img src="../images/coryphoda_raven_70sec.png" width="1500"></p>
<p>While the output is nice, it is far from customizable, and the user
can’t control the output parameters either (e.g., image dimensions). To
our knowledge, all the plot in <strong>Raven</strong> are separate
views, not allowing to add a Mean Power Spectrum aligned on the side of
the spectrogram. If we wanted to achieve the same output as in the
“multiplot” from <em>Rthoptera</em>, we would have to manually paste the
spectral plot on the side, requiring a manual adjustment of the
dimensions which would likely distort the axes labels. If we consider
iterating this process over many recordings, it translates into a very
tedious endeavor.</p>
<p>In <em>Rthoptera</em>, the final output can be obtained in about 10
seconds without these extra manual processing. First, we will load the
data from the <em>RthopteraSounds</em> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">RthopteraSounds</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://github.com/naturewaves/Rthoptera" class="external-link">Rthoptera</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/data.html" class="external-link">data</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"coryphoda"</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="co"># Load the sample recording of Coryphoda albidicollis.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, we launch the app <em>multi_plot</em> app with the following
call:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/launch_app.html">launch_app</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"multi_plot"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Here we can modify some parameters before computing the plot:
